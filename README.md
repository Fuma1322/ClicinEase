Challenge Statement
Problem to Solve
ClinicEase helps streamline appointment scheduling, improve resource utilization, and enhance patient convenience by eliminating long queues at clinics. It enables users to book appointments online, reducing waiting times and optimizing clinic workflows.

What It Won’t Solve
While ClinicEase offers valuable tools for appointment management and patient access, it does not address broader systemic issues such as healthcare infrastructure, accessibility, quality of care, affordability, social determinants of health, emergency care, and data privacy.

Target Users
ClinicEase benefits patients and clinic administrators by improving access to care and facilitating better patient-provider interactions.

Locale
The project is designed to be accessible to the local community.

Risks
Technical Risk
Frequent downtime or outages in the booking system can disrupt appointment scheduling and patient access, caused by server failures, network issues, software bugs, cyber attacks, or power outages.

Non-Technical Risks
Poor user experience, such as confusing interface design or lack of accessibility features, can lead to frustration among patients and staff, resulting in decreased usage of the system or increased reliance on manual booking methods.

Infrastructure
Branching/Merging
Manual code review and merge strategy.

Deployment Strategy
Vercel, utilizing Immutable Deployments.

Data Population
Implement patient and administrator registration processes to capture new patient and admin information, including demographics, contact details, and medical history. Ensure data entry forms are user-friendly and comply with data privacy regulations.

Testing
Emphasis on manual testing initially, with plans to incorporate automated tests using tools like Jest for backend and Cypress for frontend as the project develops.

Existing Solutions Comparison
